### Blockquotes
*Displaying the GitHub alert-style blockquotes requires javascript. MMF 2.2.3 and 3.0.2 don't have js enabled for rendering update notes. I plan to enable it for future releases using Sparkle's `SUEnableJavaScript` setting.*

> **This is a normal**
>
> Blockquote
>
> Some text
> ...Single break\
> ...Backslash (\\) single break
>
> ...Double break

> [!NOTE]
> Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.

> [!TIP]
> Optional information to help a user be more successful.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.

> [!WARNING]
> Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.

> [!CAUTION]
> Negative potential consequences of an action.

> [!CAUTION]  
> If you put more than one space after [!CAUTION], then pandoc will insert weird extra linebreaks. Update: Fixed this in our js code.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> This note has a double line break after [!NOTE]

> [!NOTE]
> **Read this if you're currently using Mac Mouse Fix 2**

> With the introduction of Mac Mouse Fix 3, I've made some changes to the pricing model:

<summary><b>Detailed Privacy Information</b></summary>
    
<br>
Previous versions validated licenses online at every launch, potentially allowing connection logs to be stored by third-party servers (GitHub and Gumroad). The new system eliminates unnecessary connections â€“ after the initial license activation, it only connects to the internet if local license data is corrupted.
<br><br>
While no user behavior was ever recorded by me personally, the previous system theoretically allowed third-party servers to log IP addresses and connection times. Gumroad could also log your license key and potentially correlate it to any personal info they recorded about you when you bought Mac Mouse Fix.
