# Readme

This folder contains so-far-unused utility code copied over from the xcode-localization-screenshot-fix repo.

Update: [Apr 2025] Is Queue.m really from xcode-localization-screenshot-fix? It says "Created by Noah Nuebling in 2020" so it seems to come from the mac-mouse-fix.
    Update 2: Ahh IIRC, we added some stuff to Queue.m.
