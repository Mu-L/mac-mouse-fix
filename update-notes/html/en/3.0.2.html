---

**Note to Mac Mouse Fix 3 Buyers**

In May 2024, I saw several people being surprised and upset because Mac Mouse Fix 3 suddenly stopped working and prompted them to buy the app. It seems that they updated from Mac Mouse Fix 2 to Mac Mouse Fix 3 without being aware of the pricing changes. 

I'm really sorry about this! I admit it was very easy to miss the information about the pricing changes for people who updated from Mac Mouse Fix 2 directly to 3.0.1 or 3.0.2. As a result, I've improved the update notes for 3.0.2 to make it harder to miss that Mac Mouse Fix 3 isn't free anymore.

I also want to offer a **refund** to anyone who felt negatively affected by this. Please [click here](https://redirect.macmousefix.com/?target=mmf-apply-for-refund) to apply for it.

Again, I'm sorry about the trouble, and I hope everyone is ok with this as a solution!

The latest version of Mac Mouse Fix 2 stays entirely free, and you can download it [here](https://redirect.macmousefix.com/?target=mmf2-latest).

-->
<!--

To get the refund, please [send me an email](<https://noah-nuebling.github.io/redirection-service?message=&target=mailto-noah&subject=Mac Mouse Fix Refund>) with "Mac Mouse Fix Refund" in the subject. Inside the message, include the email address where you received your license key and the reason why you're requesting the refund.

-->
<!-- 
If you bought Mac Mouse Fix 3 because you didn't know that you could keep using [Mac Mouse Fix 2](https://noah-nuebling.github.io/redirection-service?target=mmf2-latest) for free, then I would like to give you a refund.
-->
<!--
You can download the latest version of Mac Mouse Fix 2 [here](https://noah-nuebling.github.io/redirection-service?target=mmf2-latest). It's 100% free forever.

To anyone else who bought the app: Thank you very much for your support! :)
-->
<!-- Thank you for using Mac Mouse Fix! -->
<!--
Background: \
I think there was confusion because the original update notes for version 3.0.1 and 3.0.2 didn't explicitly mention that Mac Mouse Fix 3 isn't 100% free, like Mac Mouse Fix 2 is. \
Instead, the update notes for 3.0.1 and 3.0.2 linked to the update notes for 3.0.0 which made the pricing changes very clear, but I totally understand that this would lead to confusion for people who upgraded directly from Mac Mouse Fix 2, and should be made much clearer. So I'm sorry for that.

 ### Update Notes 

-->
<p>Mac Mouse Fix <strong>3.0.2</strong> brings several improvements,
including <strong>smoother scrolling</strong>, improved translations,
and more!</p>
<h3 id="scrolling">Scrolling</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can now stop scroll animations by scrolling one step in the
opposite direction. This allows you to <strong>‚Äòthrow‚Äô</strong> and
<strong>‚Äòcatch‚Äô the page</strong> when using ‚ÄòSmoothness: High‚Äô, similar
to a Trackpad.</li>
<li>Mac Mouse Fix now sends scroll events earlier in the display refresh
cycle, giving apps more time to process the scroll events and display
scrolling smoothly. This <strong>improves framerates</strong>,
especially on complex websites like YouTube.com.</li>
<li>Improved the responsiveness of the ‚ÄòSmoothness: High‚Äô setting,
making scrolling easier to control.
<!-- Turned speed smoothing off for the high smoothness animations curves. (Which we introduced in 3.0.0 Beta 7)--></li>
<li>Improved on a mechanism introduced in 3.0.1 where the animation
speed becomes faster as you move the scroll wheel faster when using
‚ÄòSmoothness: Regular‚Äô. In 3.0.2 the speedup of the animation should
appear more consistent and predictable, making it easier on the eyes
while providing great control.
<!-- and still providing a sense of directly pushing the content with your finger. --></li>
<li>Fixed a problem where the scrolling speed was too slow, especially
when using the ‚ÄòPrecision‚Äô option. This problem was introduced in 3.0.1.
Thanks to <span class="citation" data-cites="V-Coba">@V-Coba</span> for
drawing attention to it in <a
href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/795">795</a>.
<!-- - Turned off (except for one hacky case) additional tickTime smoothing inside scrollAnalyzer which we introduced for 3.0.1 to make baseMsPerStepMin work better. Unfortunately the additional smoothing made the scroll distance acceleration worse.--></li>
<li>Improved behaviour inside the Arc browser when using ‚ÄòClick and
Scroll‚Äô to ‚ÄòZoom In or Out‚Äô.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="localization">Localization</h3>
<ul>
<li>Updated üáªüá≥ Vietnamese translations. Credits to <span
class="citation" data-cites="nghlt">@nghlt</span>!
<!-- [792](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/pull/792)--></li>
<li>Improved some üá©üá™ German translations.</li>
<li>Text inside Mac Mouse Fix that doesn‚Äôt have a translation for the
current language will now show a placeholder value instead of just being
blank. This should make it less confusing to navigate the app when there
are missing translations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other">Other</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mac Mouse Fix will now show a notification with a link to <a
href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/discussions/861">this
guide</a> to users who might be experiencing a bug in macOS 13 Ventura
and later that can prevent Mac Mouse Fix from being enabled.
<!-- takes too long to enable. Trying to suppress enable-timeout-toast during macOS startup. Based on CPU usage based heuristic. --></li>
<li>Changed the default settings for mice with 3 buttons. The default
settings no longer feature a ‚ÄòClick and Scroll‚Äô action for the
Scrollwheel Button, since that is pretty hard to perform. Instead, the
default settings now feature a ‚ÄòHold‚Äô and a ‚ÄòDouble Click‚Äô action.
<!-- The settings are now the same as MMF 2 --></li>
<li>Added a tooltip to the Mac Mouse Fix icon on the About tab. It tells
you how to reveal Mac Mouse Fix‚Äôs config file in the Finder.</li>
<li>Lots of under-the-hood cleanup and improvements.</li>
</ul>
<!--

GitHub improvements don't really belong to the release itself I think, since it's not part of the app. 

### GitHub

- Improvements to Acknowledgements and other md files. E.g. added caching mechanism to Gumroad sales retrieval
- Updates to the Readme.
