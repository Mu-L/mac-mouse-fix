<p>Also check out the <strong>neat improvements</strong> introduced in
<a
href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/releases/tag/3.0.0-Beta-6">3.0.0
Beta 6</a>!</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>3.0.0 Beta 7</strong> brings several small improvements and
bug fixes.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s everything new:</p>
<p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added <strong>Korean translations</strong>. Big thanks to <span
class="citation" data-cites="jeongtae">@jeongtae</span>! (Find him on <a
href="https://github.com/jeongtae">GitHub</a>)</li>
<li>Made <strong>scrolling</strong> with the â€˜Smoothness: Highâ€™ option
<strong>even smoother</strong>, by only changing the speed gradually,
instead of having sudden jumps in the scrolling speed as you move the
scroll wheel. This should make scrolling feel a little smoother and
easier to follow with your eyes without making things less responsive.
Scrolling with â€˜Smoothness: Highâ€™ uses around 30% more CPU now, on my
computer it went from 1.2% CPU usage when continuously scrolling to
1.6%. So scrolling is still highly efficient and I hope this wonâ€™t make
a difference to anyone. Big thanks to <a
href="https://mos.caldis.me/">MOS</a>, which inspired this feature and
whose â€˜Scroll Monitorâ€™ I used to help implement the feature.</li>
<li>Mac Mouse Fix is now <strong>handling button inputs from all
sources</strong>. Before, Mac Mouse Fix would only handle inputs from
mice that it recognized. I think this might help compatibility with
certain mice in edge cases, like when using a Hackintosh, but it will
also lead Mac Mouse Fix to pick up artificially generated button inputs
from other apps, which might lead to problems in other edge cases. Let
me know if this leads to any problems for you, and I will address that
in future updates.</li>
<li>Refined the feel and polish of the â€˜Click and Scrollâ€™ for â€˜Desktop
&amp; Launchpadâ€™ and â€˜Click and Scrollâ€™ to â€˜Move Between Spacesâ€™
gestures.</li>
<li>Now taking the information density of a language into account when
calculating the <strong>time that notifications are shown for</strong>.
Before this, notifications would only stay visible for a very short
amount of time in languages with high information density like Chinese
or Korean.</li>
<li>Enabled <strong>different gestures</strong> to move between
<strong>Spaces</strong>, open <strong>Mission Control</strong>, or open
<strong>App ExposÃ©</strong>. In Beta 6, I made it so these actions were
only available through the â€˜Click and Dragâ€™ gesture - as an experiment
to see how many people actually cared about being able to access those
actions in other ways. It seems that some do, so now I made it possible
again to access these actions through a simple â€˜Clickâ€™ of a button or
through â€˜Click and Scrollâ€™.</li>
<li>Made it possible to <strong>Rotate</strong> through a <strong>Click
and Scroll</strong> gesture.</li>
<li><strong>Improved</strong> the way that the <strong>Trackpad
Simulation</strong> option works in some scenarios. For example when
scrolling horizontally to delete a message in Mail, the direction that
the message moves is now inverted, which I hope feels a bit more natural
and consistent to most people.</li>
<li>Added a feature to <strong>remap</strong> to <strong>Primary
Click</strong> or <strong>Secondary Click</strong>. I implemented this
because the right mouse button on my favorite mouse broke. These options
are hidden by default. You can see them by holding the Option key while
selecting an action.
<ul>
<li>This is currently lacking translations for Chinese and Korean, so if
you would like to contribute translations for these features that would
be greatly appreciated!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where the <strong>direction of â€˜Click and Dragâ€™</strong>
for â€˜Mission Control &amp; Spacesâ€™ was <strong>inverted</strong> for
people who have never toggled the â€˜Natural scrollingâ€™ option in System
Settings. Now, the direction of â€˜Click and Dragâ€™ gestures in Mac Mouse
Fix should always match the direction of gestures on your Trackpad or
Magic Mouse. If you want a separate option for inverting the â€˜Click and
Dragâ€™ direction, instead of having it follow the System Settings, let me
know.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the <strong>free days</strong> would <strong>count
up too quickly</strong> for some users. If you were affected by this,
let me know and Iâ€™ll see what I can do.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue under macOS Sonoma where the tab bar wouldnâ€™t display
properly.</li>
<li>Fixed jankiness when using â€˜macOSâ€™ scrolling speed while using
â€˜Click and Scrollâ€™ to open Launchpad.</li>
<li>Fixed crash where the â€˜Mac Mouse Fix Helperâ€™ app (which runs in the
background when Mac Mouse Fix is enabled) would crash sometimes when
recording a keyboard shortcut.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Mac Mouse Fix would crash when trying to pick up
artificial events generated by <a
href="https://github.com/artginzburg/MiddleClick-Sonoma">MiddleClick-Sonoma</a></li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the name for some mice displayed in the
â€˜Restore Defaultsâ€¦â€™ dialog would contain the manufacturer twice.</li>
<li>Made it less likely for â€˜Click and Dragâ€™ for â€˜Mission Control &amp;
Spacesâ€™ to get stuck when the computer is slow.
<!-- NOTE: I think? Or fixed memory issues with that mechanism? See a2bb5480b4a53c3dddf1cb60369ca508b4821597 --></li>
<li>Corrected use of â€˜Force Touchâ€™ in UI strings where it should be
â€˜Force clickâ€™.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that would occur for certain configurations, where
opening Launchpad or showing the Desktop through â€˜Click and Scrollâ€™
wouldnâ€™t work if you released the button while the transition animation
was still ongoing.
<!-- - Fixed bug where the your region was sometimes not read from the system settings correctly, which made some users in countries where the app should be free still have to enter a license. --- NOTE: Commenting this out, because we don't want to advertise the stuff with the free countries to much because we don't want to make it too easy to abuse it. --></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Several under-the-hood improvements, stability improvements,
under-the-hood cleanup, and more.</li>
