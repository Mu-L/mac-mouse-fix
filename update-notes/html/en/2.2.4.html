<p>Mac Mouse Fix <strong>2.2.4</strong> is now notarized! It also
includes some small bug fixes and other improvements.</p>
<h3 id="notarization"><strong>Notarization</strong></h3>
<p>Mac Mouse Fix 2.2.4 is now ‘notarized’ by Apple. That means no more
messages about Mac Mouse Fix being potentially ‘Malicious Software’ when
opening the app for the first time.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>Notarizing your app costs $100 per year. I was always against this,
since it felt hostile towards free and open source software like Mac
Mouse Fix, and it also felt like a dangerous step towards Apple
controlling and locking down the Mac like they do iPhones or iPads. But
lack of notarization led to different problems, including <a
href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/discussions/114">difficulties
opening the app</a> and even <a
href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/95">several
situations</a> where nobody could use the app anymore until I released a
new version.</p>
<p>For Mac Mouse Fix 3, I thought it was finally appropriate to pay the
$100 per year to notarize the app, since Mac Mouse Fix 3 is monetized.

More</a>)<br />
Now, Mac Mouse Fix 2 gets notarization as well, which should lead to an
easier and more stable user experience.</p>

            https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/releases/tag/3.0.0-Beta-6 
-->
<h3 id="bug-fixes"><strong>Bug fixes</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the cursor would disappear and then reappear in
a different location when using a ‘Click and Drag’ Action during a
screen recording or while using the <a
href="https://www.synaptics.com/products/displaylink-graphics">DisplayLink</a>
software.
<!--  Copied this text from 3.0.0 Beta 6 release notes --></li>
<li>Fixed an issue with enabling Mac Mouse Fix under macOS 10.14 Mojave
and possibly older macOS versions, too.
<!-- (I saw the issue on macOS 10.14 Mojave, and it's probably present on earlier versions of macOS, too) --></li>
<li>Improved memory management, potentially fixing a crash of the ‘Mac
Mouse Fix Helper’ app, that would occur when detaching a mouse from your
computer. See Discussion <a
href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/discussions/771">#771</a>.
<!-- Links to email with the crash report are in code comments. --></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-improvements"><strong>Other Improvements</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The window that the app displays to inform you that a new version of
Mac Mouse Fix is available now supports JavaScript. This allows for the
update notes to be prettier and easier to read. For example, the update
notes can now display <a
href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/16925">Markdown
Alerts</a> and more.</li>
<li>Removed a link to the https://macmousefix.com/about/ page from the
“Grant Accessibility Access to Mac Mouse Fix Helper” screen. That’s
because the About page no longer exists and has been replaced by the <a
href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix">GitHub Readme</a>
for now.</li>
<li>This release now includes dSYM files which can be used by anyone to
decode crash reports of Mac Mouse Fix 2.2.4.</li>
<li>Some under-the-hood cleanup and improvements.</li>
</ul>
