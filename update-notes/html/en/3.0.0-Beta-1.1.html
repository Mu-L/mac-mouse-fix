<p><strong>3.0.0</strong> will be the <strong>biggest update</strong> to
Mac Mouse Fix so far!</p>
<p>Bringing together many features that I‚Äôve worked on for a long time
to finally deliver this awesome <strong>value proposal</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Make your $10 mouse better than an Apple
Trackpad!</strong></p>
<p>And you can <strong>test it now</strong>! I‚Äôm really excited to hear
your guys‚Äô feedback!</p>
<p>Here is <strong>everything that‚Äôs new</strong>:</p>
<h2 id="click-and-drag-to-scroll">1. Click and Drag to Scroll</h2>
<p>You can now <strong>Click and Drag to Scroll</strong> freely in any
direction!</p>
<p>It also allows you to go back and forward in <strong>Safari</strong>,
mark messages as read in <strong>Mail</strong>, and <strong>do anything
else</strong> you can do with a <strong>two-finger swipe</strong> on an
<strong>Apple Trackpad</strong>!</p>
<p>I worked hard to implement the feature to this quality standard. But
as a result, as you play around with it, I think you‚Äôll find it really
‚Äú<strong>just works</strong>‚Äù!</p>
<h2 id="scroll-gestures">2. Scroll Gestures</h2>
<p>Mac Mouse Fix now supports <strong>Scroll Gestures</strong>! That
means you can <strong>trigger actions</strong> by
<strong>scrolling</strong> while holding down a mouse button!</p>
<p>Scroll Gestures let you get even <strong>more functionality</strong>
out of a single mouse button in a super <strong>intuitive</strong>
way.</p>
<p>In this beta, there are the <strong>following</strong> Scroll
Gestures:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Desktop &amp; Launchpad</strong> allows you to reveal the
Desktop or open Launchpad by scrolling either up or down. This feels
super fluid and intuitive because it simulates pinching with 4 fingers
on an Apple Trackpad.</li>
<li><strong>Move between Spaces</strong> lets you switch between Spaces
by scrolling up or down. This feels super fluid as well since it
simulates swiping on an Apple Trackpad with 3 fingers. However, I‚Äôm not
sure if this is redundant since you can already Click and Drag to move
between Spaces. Let me know what you think!</li>
<li><strong>Zoom in or out</strong> lets you take a closer look on the
web or elsewhere. This was already available in Mac Mouse Fix 2 by
holding the Command (‚åò) key while scrolling, but now you can do it more
easily using just one hand!</li>
<li><strong>Horizontal Scroll</strong> lets you scroll left and right.
You can also use it to navigate between pages in Safari and other apps
because simulates swiping with 2 fingers on an Apple Trackpad.</li>
<li><strong>Swift Scroll</strong> lets you scroll large distances with
minimal effort.</li>
<li><strong>Precise Scroll</strong> lets you scroll small distances and
use sensitive UI Elements like volume sliders with precision.</li>
<li><strong>App Switcher</strong> lets you switch between recent apps,
just like pressing Command-Tab (‚åò + ‚Üπ) on your keyboard. This feature
has some bugs and I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs very useful, since you can already
easily access the Tab Switcher from your keyboard, so I‚Äôll probably
remove it later. Let me know what you think, though.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="inertial-scrolling">3. Inertial Scrolling</h2>
<p><strong>Inertial Scrolling</strong> makes scrolling on your mouse
feel just as <strong>fast</strong> and <strong>fluid</strong> as an
Apple Trackpad.</p>
<p>Inertial Scrolling creates <strong>long</strong> and very
<strong>smooth animations</strong>. On a scroll wheel, long animations
generally come with the tradeoff of less control.</p>
<p>But Mac Mouse Fix 3 implements some <strong>smart algorithms</strong>
to give you a <strong>great intertial feel</strong> while still offering
a lot of <strong>control</strong>.</p>
<p>By the way, if you download this Beta, I think you‚Äôll be <strong>one
of the first</strong> humans to use <strong>scroll bouncing</strong>
from a mouse! (other than the Magic Mouse) I think that‚Äôs kinda cool.
<!-- If you want even more **control** and **responsivity**, you can still **turn it off**. --></p>
<h2 id="other-scrolling-improvements">4. Other Scrolling
Improvements</h2>
<p>I <strong>rewrote</strong> most of the scrolling code for MMF 3. This
allowed me to implement many <strong>other small features</strong> and
improvements:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There are now <strong>2 additional keyboard modifiers</strong> so
you can not only <strong>Zoom in or out</strong> with Command (‚åò), and
<strong>Scroll Horizontally</strong> with Shift (‚áß), but also
<strong>Scroll Swiftly</strong> with Control (^) and <strong>Scroll
Precisely</strong> with Option (‚å•).</li>
<li>You can now see and <strong>customize all 4 keyboard
modifiers</strong> using a beautiful and intuitive new UI.</li>
<li><strong>Always-On Precise Scrolling</strong> lets you scroll
precisely even without holding down a modifier key by moving the scroll
wheel slowly.</li>
<li><strong>Horizontal Scroll Input</strong> from your mouse is no
longer ignored, but instead it‚Äôs smoothed and inverted just like normal
vertical scroll input. If your mouse has a <strong>tilt wheel</strong>
or a <strong>horizontal scroll wheel</strong> it should feel much nicer
now.</li>
<li>The <strong>Scroll Direction Invert Settings</strong> are now
independent of the System Settings allowing for a less complicated
UI.</li>
<li><strong>Scroll settings</strong> can now be
<strong>combined</strong> more freely. For example, you can use
<strong>Mac Mouse Fix‚Äôs</strong> Scroll Speed even when Smooth Scrolling
is <strong>disabled</strong>. Or you can use <strong>macOS‚Äôs</strong>
Scroll Speed when Smooth Scrolling is <strong>enabled</strong>. (Note: I
personally don‚Äôt like macOS‚Äô Scroll Speed at all and I can‚Äôt think of
reasons why anyone would prefer it. So if you do prefer it I‚Äôd be very
interested to learn more about your experience! You can reach out
through the ‚Äú<strong>‚ìò About</strong>‚Äù Tab.)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="menu-bar-item">5. Menu Bar Item</h2>
<p>Mac Mouse Fix now has a <strong>Menu Bar Item</strong> so you can
always see when it‚Äôs enabled!</p>
<p>The Menu Bar Item has a <strong>beautiful icon</strong>, and it also
allows you to <strong>quickly disable</strong> certain features of Mac
Mouse Fix so you can play a game or use an app without Mac Mouse Fix
interfering.</p>
<p>Of course, you can also still <strong>disable</strong> it for a
cleaner Menu Bar.</p>
<h2 id="app-specific-settings-have-been-removed">6. App-Specific
Settings Have Been Removed</h2>
<p><strong>App-Specific Settings</strong> are gone for now. However, I
do plan to <strong>bring them back</strong> in a much more robust and
powerful form in the future.</p>
<p>For now, I think the quick settings in the <strong>Menu Bar</strong>
Item are a <strong>better</strong>, if less convenient, solution.</p>
<p>They <strong>solve</strong> the <strong>most important
problems</strong> of the old App-Specific Settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>App-Specific Settings didn‚Äôt work with some programs like
<strong>command line executables</strong>. This included popular apps
like <strong>Minecraft</strong>.</li>
<li>App-Specific Settings had many limitations like they didn‚Äôt allow
you to <strong>turn off buttons</strong> entirely, which was a problem
for many gamers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another thing to consider is that the old App-Specific Settings were
originally <strong>designed as a bandaid</strong> for some apps being
incompatible with the old scrolling system. But now, with the new
scrolling system precisely emulating Touch Scrolls coming from an Apple
Trackpad, most of these incompatibilities should be <strong>fixed
anyways</strong>! So there should be less of a need for what the old
App-Specific Settings were best at.</p>
<p>I hope everone is okay with that! Let me know your
<strong>thoughts</strong>!</p>
<h2 id="ui-overhaul">7. UI Overhaul</h2>
<p>I‚Äôve completely <strong>rewritten the UI</strong> to be more
<strong>beautiful</strong> and <strong>powerful</strong> while still
retaining the <strong>simplicity</strong> and <strong>ease of
use</strong> that people love about Mac Mouse Fix.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs new:</p>
<ul>
<li>The UI is now split up into different <strong>tabs</strong>. This
cleans things up and allows Mac Mouse Fix to provide additional settings
that are important to people without the UI becoming too complicated or
overwhelming. This will also allow me to extend Mac Mouse Fix with new
features in the future.</li>
<li>I added subtle and delightful little <strong>animations</strong> all
over the new UI that make it easier to navigate and add a feeling of
polish.</li>
<li>Options that depend on other options will be <strong>hidden</strong>
and the layout will adjust with beautiful subtle animations. This keeps
things as simple and streamlined as possible. So you don‚Äôt have to waste
time and brainpower looking at options that you don‚Äôt need to be
thinking about.</li>
<li>The new UI features small <strong>hints</strong> for options that
can otherwise be confusing.</li>
<li>The <strong>new Action Table design</strong> makes it much clearer
how to add and remove Actions, which many people were confused by. It
also shrinks and grows to fit the number of Actions so you don‚Äôt have to
resize it manually.</li>
<li>The new <strong>About Tab</strong> features a beautiful layout, and
puts additional options for support, feedback, and more at your
fingertips.</li>
<li>Some <strong>existing UI strings</strong> have been improved.</li>
<li>There‚Äôs now a <strong>new option</strong> to Lock the Mouse Pointer
during Click and Drag Gestures. I don‚Äôt have one to test, but this
should be very nice for Trackball-Mice!
<!-- - ?? The UI layout is very simple and every detail is very well considered, to provide all the options you need while being as minimal and clear as possible. --></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="monetization">8. Monetization</h2>
<p>Mac Mouse Fix 3 will be <strong>free for 30 days</strong> and then
cost <strong>$1.99</strong> to own.</p>
<p>I know that paying for something that used to be free is not the best
feeling, but I hope I can convince you that it‚Äôs a really <strong>good
thing for the project</strong>!</p>
<p>Like for every other aspect of Mac Mouse Fix, I paid great attention
to making the <strong>user experience</strong> as
<strong>simple</strong> and <strong>pleasant</strong> as possible:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The <strong>30 free days</strong> are smartly implemented. Mac Mouse
Fix <strong>only counts the days</strong> on which you <strong>actually
use it</strong>. So there‚Äôs <strong>no pressure</strong> to use the app
before the time is up, and you can make an informed decision whether you
want to buy the app or not without any stress.</li>
<li>After the 30 free days are over, <strong>paying</strong> for the app
is extremely <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>fast</strong>. You can
use all the payment methods you love like <strong>Apple Pay</strong> and
<strong>PayPal</strong>, and it only takes <strong>2 clicks</strong> to
pay from inside the app via Apple Pay!</li>
<li>After you bought the app for $1.99, <strong>activating your
license</strong> is also extremely <strong>simple</strong>. I actually
put a <strong>link</strong> on the <strong>checkout screen</strong> in
the web browser that takes you <strong>directly</strong> into the app
and opens the <strong>screen for entering the license</strong> for
you!</li>
<li>After you <strong>activate your license</strong>, there‚Äôs a cute
randomized <strong>thank you message</strong> on the about tab. (I heard
there are even some super secret rare ones‚Ä¶)</li>
<li>Your license is <strong>synced via iCloud</strong> so it will
automatically be available on all your computers!</li>
</ol>
<p>By helping Mac Mouse Fix financially, you can also help me
<strong>spend a lot more time</strong> on it and make it the
<strong>best mouse driver EVERRR</strong>. I also <em>love</em> spending
time on Mac Mouse Fix, so that would also make me <strong>happy</strong>
:)</p>
<p><strong>Will Mac Mouse Fix still be Open Source?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Mac Mouse Fix will still be open source, and I don‚Äôt plan to
change that at any point.</p>
<p>This also means you <em>can</em> use Mac Mouse Fix for free by
building it from source and disabling the licensing checks. That‚Äôs
perfectly fine, I just discourage sharing these cracked versions online.
And of course, on the next update, you‚Äôll get a non-cracked version
which means you‚Äôll have to do this again for every update. (Or just pay
$1.99 for the greatest mouse driver ever! :)</p>
<p>Anyone will also still be able to use source code from Mac Mouse Fix
in their free and commercial products as long as they don‚Äôt just sell a
copy of Mac Mouse Fix without adding their own contribution.</p>
<p>Learn about the details in the new <a
href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/blob/version-3/LICENSE">MMF
License</a> which MMF 3 will be licensed under.</p>
<p><strong>Will I have to pay to use the Mac Mouse Fix 3
Beta?</strong></p>
<p>No.¬†You can just use your 30 free days. The free day counter probably
won‚Äôt reset when the stable version of Mac Mouse Fix 3 releases, since
that would be extra stuff to design and implement and I don‚Äôt think
anyone will care too much. (Let me know if you do). But I will extend
the number of free days if the beta goes on for more than 30 days.</p>
<p><strong>Can I get Mac Mouse Fix for free if I already
donated?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! If you bought me a milkshake before the 10th of September 2022,
you can write an email to noah.n.public@gmail.com with ‚ÄúMilkshake Karma‚Äù
in the subject and a screenshot as proof and then I‚Äôll send you a 100%
off discount code or something!</p>
<h2 id="internationalization">9. Internationalization</h2>
<p>With the UI rewrite, it‚Äôs now possible to <strong>translate</strong>
Mac Mouse Fix into different languages!</p>
<p>I already translated it into <strong>German</strong>, my native
language, and you can translate it into <strong>your language</strong>,
too!</p>
<p>I plan to write a more <strong>detailed guide</strong> on this in the
future, but if you want to give it a go, here‚Äôs a small overview of the
<strong>steps</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Download</strong> the source code &amp; Xcode</li>
<li><strong><a
href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-support-for-languages-and-regions">Add
your language</a></strong> to the project</li>
<li>Put your translations into the
<strong><code>.strings</code></strong> and
<strong><code>.stringsdict</code></strong> files throughout the
project</li>
<li><strong>Commit</strong> your changes and create a <strong>pull
request</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If your translation is added to the project you‚Äôll get <strong>10 MMF
copies for free</strong>, and of course, you‚Äôll be <strong>credited as a
contributor</strong>. I heard you can also leave your <strong>personal
message</strong> by changing some of the (secret rare thank you
messages) on the About tab.</p>
<p>Maybe I‚Äôll add <strong>more perks</strong> in the future. Let me know
if you have any <strong>ideas</strong> for that!</p>
<h2 id="how-you-can-help">10. How You Can Help</h2>
