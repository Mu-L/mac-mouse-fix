### Changes in Beta 12

This update features small improvements:

- Mac Mouse Fix will now automatically repair the permissions on the ~/Library/LaunchAgents folder. This fixes an issue where some people couldn't enable Mac Mouse Fix.
  - Thanks to @maddn who found the cause of this problem in Issue #117, and to everyone else who reported the issue.
- Resolved an issue where Click and Drag wouldn't work when Caps Lock was enabled. Fixes #136.
- When using Click and Drag to move between Spaces, the animation follows the mouse pointer more closely.
- Removed the colon at the end of the label of the Smooth scrolling checkbox as @FraserEmbrey suggested in Issue #135.
- Improved UI strings.
