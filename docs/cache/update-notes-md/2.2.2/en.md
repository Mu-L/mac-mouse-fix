The **previous release** [**2.2.1**](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/releases/tag/2.2.1) added support for **macOS 13 Ventura** and more!

Mac Mouse Fix **2.2.2** brings several **small fixes** and improvements.

### Accessibility problems

2.2.2 solves a problem where "Mac Mouse Fix Helper" couldn't be granted **Accessibility Access** in System Settings after updating from Mac Mouse Fix 2.2.0 or earlier. See GitHub Issue [#412](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/412).

### Bug fixes

- Fixed issue where **notifications** would disappear abruptly instead of fading out with an animation under macOS Ventura
- Fixed bug where **links** on the "More..." screen and the "Grant Accessibiliy Access" screen would sometimes open over and over again when clicking anywhere in the Mac Mouse Fix window

### Other improvements

- Improved **UI strings** on "Grant Accessibiliy Access" screen
- **Under-the-hood** improvements
