Mac Mouse Fix **2.2.3** fixes several issues and adds **polish** under macOS **10.13** High Sierra, **10.14** Mojave, and **10.15** Catalina.

It took a lot of **time** to test and debug the app on older macOS versions, but I'm really **glad** I did since I wanted to make sure that Mac Mouse Fix 2.2 - the last **free** version of Mac Mouse Fix - feels really nice and polished for **everyone**! 

(Mac Mouse Fix 3 will be free for 30 days and then cost a few dollars to own)

### What's changed

- Fixed a bug where the 'Keyboard Shortcut...' option wouldn't do anything under macOS 10.13 High Sierra
- Fixed a crash when using the 'Keyboard Shortcut...' option more than once under macOS 10.13 High Sierra and 10.14 Mojave
- Enabled Apple icon rendering on macOS versions before macOS 11 Big Sur. Icons will now display properly in the 'More...' screen, when right-clicking the Action Table, and when recording keyboard shortcuts containing special keys only found on Apple keyboards.
- Fixed text being cut off on the 'More Sheet' on macOS versions before macOS 11 Big Sur
- Improved visual attributes of the Action Table like color and text margins on macOS versions before macOS 11 Big Sur
- Improved color of Toast Notications on macOS versions before macOS 11 Big Sur
- Reduced application size
- More under-the hood improvements
