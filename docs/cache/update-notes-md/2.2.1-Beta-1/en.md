### Ventura support!
Mac Mouse Fix now fully supports macOS 13 Ventura.
Special thanks to [@chamburr](https://github.com/chamburr) who helped with Ventura support in GitHub Issue [#297](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/297).

### Dropped support for older macOS versions

Unfortunately, Apple only lets you develop _for_ macOS 10.13 **High Sierra and later** when developing _from_ macOS 13 Ventura. 

So the **minimum supported version** has increased from 10.11 El Capitan to 10.13 High Sierra.

I'm sorry about this. But to cheer you up there's a chill ladybug in the next section.

### Bug fixes üêû 
- Fixed a crash in '**App-specific settings**' when trying to add an app without a 'Bundle ID'. Might help with GitHub Issues [#289](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/289) and [#241](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/241).
- Fixed an issue where Mac Mouse Fix changes the scrolling behaviour of some **drawing tablets**. See GitHub Issue [#249](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/249).
- Fixed an issue where **keyboard shortcuts** including the 'A' key couldn't be recorded. Fixes GitHub Issue [#275](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/275).
- Fixed an issue where some button **remappings** wouldn't work properly when using a non-standard keyboard layout.
- **Other** small fixes and visual improvements.
