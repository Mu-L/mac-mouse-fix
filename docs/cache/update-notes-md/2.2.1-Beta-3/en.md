Mac Mouse Fix __2.2.1 Beta 3__ brings back compatibility with older macOS versions & more.

- Fixed crash on launch under older macOS versions. Should resolve Issue [#327](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/327).
- Fixed a crash when trying to add apps which don't have an app name to App-Specific Settings. Should resolve Issue [#241](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/241). Special thanks to [jeongtae](https://github.com/jeongtae) who was very helpful in figuring out the problem!
- More small bug fixes and under-the-hood improvements.
