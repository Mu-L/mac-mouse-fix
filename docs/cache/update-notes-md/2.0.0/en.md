# Mac Mouse Fix 2 is here! ðŸŽ‰

Mac Mouse Fix 2 makes your Mouse even better.

## Mouse Gestures done right.

**Click** a Mouse Button **and Drag** in different directions to enter **Mission Control**, **move between Spaces**, or see **all windows of the current app** - all using just a single Button!

Mac Mouse Fix Gestures feel much more **fluid and responsive** than any other driver on the market.
This is possible because Mac Mouse Fix can precisely emulate the output of Apple's Trackpad driver.

## With great power comes great ... ease of use!

With the new **Action Table**, you can set up your Mouse exactly how you want it - in seconds.

Move the pointer into the "+" field, then simply show Mac Mouse Fix the clicks and drags that you want to assign a new Action to.

Adding an Action for Double-Clicking the Middle Mouse Button is super simple. ^

## A major boost to your productivity.

Mouse Gestures, together with the new Action Table allow you to get **7x more functionality out of a single Button** compared to conventional mouse drivers. All while being so simple and intuitive that you'll actually use all those features.

This way anyone can leverage the convenient navigation options that make macOS so powerful - from any mouse. Even the simplest ones.



For example, with the default configuration, you can use all these Actions using **just the Middle Mouse Button**:

- Mission Control
- Move Left a Space
- Move Right a Space
- App ExposÃ©
- Show Desktop
- Launchpad
- Look Up

And this is right out of the box. Without even tapping into the endless, yet easy-to-use customization options.

## ... And a lot more

### Neat features

- **Keyboard Shortcuts** right from your Mouse give you even more flexibility for your workflow.
- **Smart zoom** allows you to get a better glance on the web and elsewhere.

### UI refinements

- New **Help and Feedback** options are now easily accessible in the app where you need them.
- **Set up** is easier and more streamlined.

### Improved update experience

The new and improved **Update Mechanism** ...

- is secure against man in the middle attacks.
- lets you test the latest Beta version - hassle-free!
- features an improved UI.
- lets me count downloads without relying on Google Analytics or other frameworks that might compromise your privacy.

### Reliability enhancements

- Various bug fixes and stability improvements.

Mac Mouse Fix started out as a little hobby project to teach myself programming. But due to your support and encouragement, my goal is now to create the **Best Mouse Driver Ever**. Today we came quite a bit closer to that goal. Thank you! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ :)
