### Changes in Beta 9

This beta features some bug fixes and quality of life improvements when running in a multi-user environment. \
See this [Github Issue](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/93) for more info.

### How you can help

- File a Bug Report if anything is wrong or not quite right with the new updating mechanism
- Describe your thoughts and experiences with the new UI in general. Have you found anything confusing or struggled to make the app work how you want it to? Let me know!
- Share your opinions and improvement ideas on new UI text.\
   There is quite a lot of new text in the app. I'd love for it to strike a great balance between unambiguity and simplicity. If anything strikes you as suboptimal, let me know!
- File a bug report if anything else goes wrong.
- If you have any other ideas or opinions, I'd love to hear them, too!
