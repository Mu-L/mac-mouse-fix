### The app works again.

I signed the app with a new certificate. The old certificate was revoked by Apple which renders old versions of Mac Mouse Fix unusable. See [this post](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/discussions/114) for more info.

### New feature!

You can now control **Media Playback**, **Speaker Volume**, **Display Brightness** and more right from your mouse! 
This is possible because Mac Mouse Fix now lets you remap your mouse buttons to any key on your keyboard - even Apple's proprietary function keys like "Play-Pause" or "Mute Speaker".
