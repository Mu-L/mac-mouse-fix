## Monetization

Before you upgrade to Mac Mouse Fix 3 from Mac Mouse Fix 2, there's one thing you might want to know:

Mac Mouse Fix 3 will be **free for 30 days** and cost **$1.99** to own.\
(It will launch at this price. I might adjust the pricing down the line.)

I know that monetization might not seem good for users at first glance, but I hope I implemented it in a way that everyone can get on board with.

- **It's pressure-free**
   Your free days are only used up when you actually use Mac Mouse Fix. So there's no pressure to use the app before the time is up, and you can make an informed decision whether you want to buy the app or not without any stress.
- **It syncs via iCloud**
  Your license is synced via iCloud so it will automatically be available on all your computers!
- **It's convenient**\
   Paying for the app and activating your license is super fast and intuitive. And you can even pay with **Apple Pay**!
- **It's cute**\
   After you activate your license, there's a cute randomized **thank you message** on the "About" tab :)
- **You support the project**\
   By supporting the project financially, you allow me to keep working towards my dream of making Mac Mouse Fix the best mouse driver *of all time*! üöÄ

If you already bought me a milkshake - thank you so much! In return, I will provide you with a free license. See the [Acknowledgements](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/blob/master/Acknowledgements.md#-paypal-donations) for more info.

If you would like to keep using Mac Mouse Fix 2 - that's okay as well. It will remain free forever and I plan to make sure that it keeps working on future macOS versions.
