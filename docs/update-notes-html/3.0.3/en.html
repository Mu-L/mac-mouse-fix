<hr />

<p>Mac Mouse Fix <strong>3.0.3</strong> is ready for macOS 15 Sequoia.

It also fixes some stability issues and provides several small

improvements.</p>

<h3 id="macos-15-sequoia-support">macOS 15 Sequoia support</h3>

<p>The app now works properly under macOS 15 Sequoia!</p>

<ul>

<li>Most UI animations were broken under macOS 15 Sequoia. Now

everything’s working properly again!</li>

<li>The source code is now buildable under macOS 15 Sequoia. Before,

there were issues with the Swift compiler preventing the app from

building.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="addressing-scroll-crashes">Addressing scroll crashes</h3>

<p>Since Mac Mouse Fix 3.0.2 there were <a

href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/988">multiple

reports</a> of Mac Mouse Fix periodically disabling and re-enabling

itself while scrolling. This was caused by crashes of the ‘Mac Mouse Fix

Helper’ background app. This update attempts to fix these crashes, with

the following changes:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The scrolling mechanism will try to recover and keep running

instead of crashing, when it encounters the edge case that seems to have

led to these crashes.</p></li>

<li><p>I changed the way that unexpected states are handled in the app

more generally: Instead of always crashing immediately, the app will now

try to recover from unexpected states in many cases.</p>

<ul>

<li>This change contributes to the fixes for the scroll crashes

described above. It might also prevent other crashes.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

<p>Sidenote: I could never reproduce these crashes on my machine, and

I’m still not sure what caused them, but based on the reports I

received, this update should prevent any crashes. If you still

experience crashes while scrolling or if you <em>did</em> experience

crashes under 3.0.2, it would be valuable if you shared your experience

and diagnostic data in GitHub Issue <a

href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/988">#988</a>.

This would help me understand the issue and improve Mac Mouse Fix. Thank

you!</p>

<h3 id="addressing-scroll-stutters">Addressing scroll stutters</h3>

<p>In 3.0.2 I made changes to how Mac Mouse Fix sends scroll events to

the system in an attempt to reduce scroll stutters likely caused by

issues with Apple’s VSync APIs.</p>

<p>However, after more extensive testing and feedback, it seems that the

new mechanism in 3.0.2 makes scrolling smoother in some scenarios but

more stuttery in others. Especially in Firefox it seemed to be

noticeably worse.<br />

Overall, it was not clear that the new mechanism actually improved

scroll stutters across the board. Also, it might have contributed to the

scroll crashes described above.</p>

<p>That’s why I disabled the new mechanism and reverted the VSync

mechanism for scroll events back to how it was in Mac Mouse Fix 3.0.0

and 3.0.1.</p>

<p>See GitHub Issue <a

href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/875">#875</a>

for more info.</p>

<h3 id="refund">Refund</h3>

<p>I am sorry for the trouble related to the scrolling changes in 3.0.1

and 3.0.2. I vastly underestimated the problems that would come with

that, and I was slow to address these issues. I’ll do my best to learn

from this experience and be more careful with such changes in the

future. I’d also like to offer anyone affected a refund. Just click <a
