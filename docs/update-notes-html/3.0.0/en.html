Fix.<br />

Bringing together many features that I’ve worked on for a long time to

finally deliver this awesome value proposition:</p>

<p><strong>Make your $10 mouse better than an Apple

Trackpad!</strong></p>

Beta 7</a> and the previous Betas for even more details.</p>

<h2 id="monetization">Monetization</h2>

<p>Before you upgrade to Mac Mouse Fix 3 from Mac Mouse Fix 2, there’s

one thing you might want to know:</p>

<p>Mac Mouse Fix 3 will be <strong>free for 30 days</strong> and cost

<strong>$1.99</strong> to own.<br />

(It will launch at this price. I might adjust the pricing down the

line.)</p>

<p>I know that monetization might not seem good for users at first

glance, but I hope I implemented it in a way that everyone can get on

board with.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>It’s pressure-free</strong> Your free days are only used up

when you actually use Mac Mouse Fix. So there’s no pressure to use the

app before the time is up, and you can make an informed decision whether

you want to buy the app or not without any stress.</li>

<li><strong>It syncs via iCloud</strong> Your license is synced via

iCloud so it will automatically be available on all your computers!</li>

<li><strong>It’s convenient</strong><br />

Paying for the app and activating your license is super fast and

intuitive. And you can even pay with <strong>Apple Pay</strong>!</li>

<li><strong>It’s cute</strong><br />

After you activate your license, there’s a cute randomized <strong>thank

you message</strong> on the “About” tab :)</li>

<li><strong>You support the project</strong><br />

By supporting the project financially, you allow me to keep working

towards my dream of making Mac Mouse Fix the best mouse driver <em>of

all time</em>! 🚀</li>

</ul>

<p>If you already bought me a milkshake - thank you so much! In return,

I will provide you with a free license. See the <a

href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/blob/master/Acknowledgements.md#-paypal-donations">Acknowledgements</a>

for more info.</p>

<p>If you would like to keep using Mac Mouse Fix 2 - that’s okay as

well. It will remain free forever and I plan to make sure that it keeps

working on future macOS versions.</p>

<p>I hope everyone feels okay about monetization in Mac Mouse Fix 3 and

<strong>thank you so much</strong> for all your support so far! :)</p>
