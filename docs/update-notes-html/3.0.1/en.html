<p>Mac Mouse Fix <strong>3.0.1</strong> brings several bug fixes and

improvements, along with a <strong>new language</strong>!</p>

<h3 id="vietnamese-was-added">Vietnamese was added!</h3>

<p>Mac Mouse Fix is now available in ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³ Vietnamese. Big thanks to <span

class="citation" data-cites="nghlt">@nghlt</span> <a

href="https://GitHub.com/nghlt">on GitHub</a>!</p>

<h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

<ul>

<li>Mac Mouse Fix now works properly with <strong>Fast User

Switching</strong>!

<ul>

<li>Fast User Switching is when you log into a second macOS account

without logging out of the first account.</li>

<li>Before this update, scrolling stopped working after a fast user

switch. Now everything should work correctly.</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Fixed a small bug where the layout of the Buttons tab was too wide

after starting Mac Mouse Fix for the first time.</li>

<li>Made the â€˜+â€™ field work more reliably when adding several Actions in

quick succession.</li>

<li>Fixed an obscure crash reported by <span class="citation"

data-cites="V-Coba">@V-Coba</span> in Issue <a

href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/735">735</a>.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="other-improvements">Other improvements</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Scrolling feels more responsive</strong> when using the

â€˜Smoothness: Regularâ€™ setting.

<ul>

<li>The animation speed now becomes faster as you move the scroll wheel

faster. That way, it feels more responsive when you scroll fast while

feeling just as smooth when you scroll slowly.</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Made the <strong>scroll speed acceleration</strong> more stable and

predictable.</li>

<li>Implemented a mechanism to <strong>keep your settings</strong> when

you update to a new Mac Mouse Fix version.

<ul>

<li>Before, Mac Mouse Fix would reset all your settings after updating

to a new version, if the structure of the settings changed. Now, Mac

Mouse Fix will attempt to upgrade the structure of your settings and

keep your preferences.</li>

<li>So far, this only works, when updating from 3.0.0 to 3.0.1. If

youâ€™re updating from an older version than 3.0.0, or if you

<em>downgrade</em> from 3.0.1 <em>to</em> a previous version, your

settings will still be reset.</li>

</ul></li>

<li>The layout of the Buttons tab now better adapts its width to

different languages.</li>

<li>Improvements to the <a

href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix#background">GitHub

Readme</a> and other documents.</li>

<li>Improved localization systems. The translation files are now

automatically cleaned up and analyzed for potential issues. Thereâ€™s a

new <a

href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/discussions/731">Localization

Guide</a> which features any automatically detected issues along with

other useful info and instructions for people who want to help translate

Mac Mouse Fix. Removed dependency on the <a

href="https://github.com/FlineDev/BartyCrouch">BartyCrouch</a> tool

which was previously used to get some of this functionality.</li>

<li>Improved several UI strings in English and German.</li>

<li>Lots of under-the-hood cleanup and improvements.</li>

</ul>
