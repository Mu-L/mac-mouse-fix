<p>Mac Mouse Fix <strong>3.0.4 Beta 1</strong> improves privacy,

efficiency, and reliability.<br />

It introduces a new offline licensing system, and fixes several

important bugs.</p>

<h3 id="enhanced-privacy-efficiency">Enhanced Privacy &amp;

Efficiency</h3>

<ul>

<li>Introduces a new offline license validation system that minimizes

internet connections.</li>

<li>The app now connects to the internet only when absolutely necessary,

protecting your privacy and reducing resource usage.</li>

<li>The app operates completely offline during normal use when

licensed.</li>

</ul>

<details>

<summary>

<b>Detailed Privacy Information</b>

</summary>

<p>Previous versions validated licenses online at every launch,

potentially allowing connection logs to be stored by third-party servers

(GitHub and Gumroad). The new system eliminates unnecessary connections

– after the initial license activation, it only connects to the internet

if local license data is corrupted. <br><br> While no user behavior was

ever recorded by me personally, the previous system theoretically

allowed third-party servers to log IP addresses and connection times.

Gumroad could also log your license key and potentially correlate it to

any personal info they recorded about you when you bought Mac Mouse Fix.

<br><br> I didn’t consider these subtle privacy issues when I built the

original licensing system, but now, Mac Mouse Fix is as private and

internet-free as possible! <br><br> Also see

<a href=https://gumroad.com/privacy>Gumroad’s privacy policy</a> and

this

comment</a> of mine.</p>

</details>

<h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>

<li>Fixed a bug where macOS would sometimes get stuck when using ‘Click

and Drag’ for ‘Spaces &amp; Mission Control’.</li>

<li>Fixed a bug where keyboard shortcuts in System Settings would

sometimes get deleted when using a ‘Click’ action defined in Mac Mouse

Fix such as ‘Mission Control’.</li>

<li>Fixed <a

href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22%27Free%20days%20are%20over%27%20bug%22">a

bug</a> where the app would sometimes stop working and show a

notification that the ‘Free days are over’ to users who had already

bought the app.

<ul>

<li>If you experienced this bug, I sincerely apologize for the

inconvenience. You can apply for a <a

href="https://redirect.macmousefix.com/?message=&amp;target=mmf-apply-for-refund">refund

here</a>.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

<h3 id="technical-improvements">Technical Improvements</h3>

<ul>

<li>Implemented a new ‘MFDataClass’ system allowing for cleaner data

modeling and human-readable configuration files.</li>

<li>Built support for adding payment platforms other than Gumroad. So in

the future, there might be localized checkouts, and the app might be

sold to different countries!</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="dropped-unofficial-support-for-macos-10.14-mojave">Dropped

(Unofficial) Support for macOS 10.14 Mojave</h3>

<p>Mac Mouse Fix 3 officially supports macOS 11 Big Sur and later.

However, for users willing to accept some glitches and graphical issues,

Mac Mouse Fix 3.0.3 and earlier could still be used on macOS 10.14.4

Mojave.</p>

<p>Mac Mouse Fix 3.0.4 drops that support and <strong>now requires macOS

10.15 Catalina</strong>.<br />

I apologize for any inconvenience caused by this. This change allowed me

to implement the improved licensing system using modern Swift features.

Mojave users can continue using Mac Mouse Fix <a

href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/releases/tag/3.0.3">3.0.3</a>

or the <a

href="https://redirect.macmousefix.com/?target=mmf2-latest">latest

version of Mac Mouse Fix 2</a>. I hope that’s a good solution for

everyone.</p>
