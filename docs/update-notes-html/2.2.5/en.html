<p>Mac Mouse Fix <strong>2.2.5</strong> features improvements to the

update-mechanism, and it’s ready for macOS 15 Sequoia!</p>

<h3 id="new-sparkle-update-framework">New Sparkle update framework</h3>

<p>Mac Mouse Fix uses the <a

href="https://sparkle-project.org/">Sparkle</a> update framework to help

provide a great updating experience.</p>

<p>With 2.2.5, Mac Mouse Fix switches from using Sparkle 1.26.0 to the

latest Sparkle <a

href="https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/releases/tag/1.27.3">1.27.3</a>,

containing security fixes, localization improvements and more.</p>

<h3 id="smarter-update-mechanism">Smarter update mechanism</h3>

<p>There’s a new mechanism that decides which update to show the user.

The behavior changed in these ways:</p>

<ol type="1">

<li>After you skip a <strong>major</strong> update (such as 2.2.5 -&gt;

3.0.0), you’ll still be notified of new <strong>minor</strong> updates

(such as 2.2.5 -&gt; 2.2.6).

<ul>

<li>This allows you to easily stay on Mac Mouse Fix 2 while still

receiving updates, as discussed in GitHub Issue <a

href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/962">#962</a>.</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Instead of showing the update to the latest release, Mac Mouse Fix

will now show you the update to the first release of the latest major

version.

<ul>

<li>Example: If you’re using MMF 2.2.5, and MMF 3.4.5 is the latest

version, the app will now show you the first version of MMF 3 (3.0.0),

instead of the latest version (3.4.5). This way, all MMF 2.2.5 users see

the MMF 3.0.0 changelog before switching to MMF 3.</li>

<li>Discussion:

<ul>

<li>The main motivation behind this is that, earlier this year, many MMF

2 users updated directly from MMF 2 to MMF 3.0.1, or 3.0.2. Since they

never saw the 3.0.0 changelog, they missed any info about the pricing

changes between MMF 2 and MMF 3 (MMF 3 no longer being 100% free). So

when MMF 3 suddenly said they need to pay to continue using the app,

some were - understandably - a bit confused and upset.</li>

<li>Disadvantage: If you just want to update to the latest version,

you’ll now have to update twice in some cases. This is slightly

inefficient, but it should still only take a few seconds. And since this

makes the changes between major versions much more transparent, I think

it’s a sensible tradeoff.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>

</ol>

<p>Mac Mouse Fix 2.2.5 will work great on the new macOS 15 Sequoia -

just like 2.2.4 did.</p>
