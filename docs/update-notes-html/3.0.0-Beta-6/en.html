<p>Also check out the <strong>neat changes</strong> introduced in <a

href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/releases/tag/3.0.0-Beta-5">3.0.0

Beta 5</a>!</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>3.0.0 Beta 6</strong> brings deep optimizations and polish, a

rework of the scroll settings, Chinese translations, and more!</p>

<p>Here’s everything new:</p>

<h2 id="deep-optimizations">1. Deep Optimizations</h2>

<p>For this Beta, I put a lot of work into getting the last bit of

performance out of Mac Mouse Fix. And now I’m happy to announce that,

when you click a mouse button in Beta 6, that’s <strong>2x</strong>

faster compared to the previous beta! And scrolling is even

<strong>4x</strong> faster!</p>

<p>With Beta 6, MMF will also smartly turn parts of itself off to save

your CPU and battery as much as possible.</p>

<p>For example, when you’re currently using a mouse with 3 buttons but

you only have actions set up for buttons not found on your mouse like

buttons 4 and 5, Mac Mouse Fix will stop listening to button input from

your mouse entirely. Meaning 0% CPU usage when you click a button on

your mouse! Or when the scroll settings in MMF match the system, Mac

Mouse Fix will stop listening to input from your scroll wheel entirely.

Meaning 0% CPU usage when you scroll! But if you set up the Command

(⌘)-Scroll to Zoom feature, Mac Mouse Fix will start to listen to your

scroll wheel input - but only while you hold down the Command (⌘) key.

And so on. So it’s really smart and will only use up CPU when it has

to!</p>

<p>This means, MMF is now not only the most powerful, easy-to-use, and

polished mouse driver for Mac, it’s also one of, if not the, most

optimized and efficient!</p>

<h2 id="reduced-app-size">2. Reduced App Size</h2>

<p>At 16 MB, Beta 6 is ca. 2x smaller than Beta 5!</p>

<p>This is a side-effect of dropping support for older macOS

versions.</p>

<h2 id="dropped-support-for-older-macos-versions">3. Dropped Support for

Older macOS Versions</h2>

<p>I tried hard to get MMF 3 to run properly on macOS versions before

macOS 11 Big Sur. But the amount of work to get it to feel polished

turned out to be overwhelming, so I had to give up on that.</p>

<p>Moving forward, the earliest officially supported version will be

macOS 11 Big Sur.</p>

<p>The app will still open on older versions but there will be visual

and maybe other problems. The app will not open anymore on macOS

versions before 10.14.4. This is what allows us to shrink the app size

by 2x since 10.14.4 is the earliest macOS version shipping with modern

Swift libraries (See “Swift ABI Stability”), which means those Swift

libraries don’t have to be contained in the app anymore.</p>

<h2 id="scroll-improvements">4. Scroll Improvements</h2>

<p>Beta 6 features many improvements to the configuration and the UI of

the new scrolling systems introduced in MMF 3.</p>

<h3 id="ui">UI</h3>

<ul>

<li>Greatly simplified and shortened the UI text on the Scroll tab. Most

mentions of the word “Scroll” have been removed since it’s implied by

context.</li>

<li>Reworked the scroll smoothness settings to be much clearer and allow

for some additional options. Now you can pick between a “Smoothness” of

“Off”, “Regular”, or “High”, Replacing the old “with Inertia” toggle. I

think this is much clearer and it made space in the UI for the new

“Trackpad Simulation” option.</li>

<li>Turning off the new “Trackpad Simulation” option disables the rubber

band effect while scrolling, it also prevents scrolling between pages in

Safari and other apps, and more. Lots of people have been annoyed by

this, especially those with free-spinning scroll wheels as found on some

Logitech Mice like the MX Master, but others enjoy it, so I decided to

make it an option. I hope the presentation of the feature is clear. If

you have any suggestions there, let me know.</li>

<li>Changed the “Natural Scroll Direction” option to “Reverse Scroll

Direction”. This means the setting now reverses the system scroll

direction and is no longer independent of the system scroll direction.

While this is arguably a slightly worse user experience, this new way of

doing things allows us to implement some optimizations and it makes it

more transparent to the user how to completely turn Mac Mouse Fix off

for scrolling.</li>

<li>Improved the way that the scroll settings interact with modified

scrolling in many different edge cases. E.g. the “Precision” option will

no longer apply to the “Click and Scroll” for “Desktop &amp; Launchpad”

action since it’s a hindrance here instead of being helpful.</li>

<li>Improved scroll speed when using “Click and Scroll” for “Desktop

&amp; Launchpad” or “Zoom In or Out” and other features.</li>

<li>Removed non-functioning link to the system scroll speed settings on

the scroll tab which was present on macOS versions before macOS 13.0

Ventura. I couldn’t find a way to make the link work and it’s not

terribly important.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="scroll-feel">Scroll Feel</h3>

<ul>

<li>Improved animation curve for “Regular Smoothness” (formerly

accessible by turning “with Inertia” off). This makes things feel more

smooth and responsive.</li>

<li>Improved the feel of all the scroll speed settings. The “Medium”

speed and the “Fast” speed are faster. There is more separation between

“Low” “Medium” and “High” speeds. The speedup as you move the

scrollwheel faster feels more natural and comfortable when using the

“Precision” option.</li>

<li>The way that the scrolling speed ramps up as you keep scrolling in

one direction will feel more natural and gradual. I’m using new

mathematical curves to model the speedup. The speed ramp-up will also be

harder to trigger accidentally.</li>

<li>Not ramping up scrolling speed anymore when you keep scrolling in

one direction while using the “macOS” scrolling speed.</li>

<li>Restricted the scroll animation time to a maximum. If the scroll

animation would naturally take more time it will be sped up to stay

below the maximum time. That way, scrolling into the page edge with a

free-spinning wheel will not have the page content move off-screen for

as long. This shouldn’t affect normal scrolling with a non-free-spinning

wheel.</li>

<li>Improved some interactions around the rubberband effect when

scrolling into a page edge in Safari and other apps.</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where “Click and Scroll” and other scroll-related

features wouldn’t work properly after upgrading from a very old

preference pane version of Mac Mouse Fix.</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where single-pixel scrolls were sent with a delay

when using the “macOS” scrolling speed together with smooth

scrolling.</li>

<li>Fixed a bug where scrolling would still be really fast after

releasing the Swift Scroll modifier. Other improvements around how

scroll speed is carried over from previous scroll swipes.</li>

<li>Improved the way that the scroll speed increases with larger display

sizes</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="notarization">5. Notarization</h2>

<p>Starting with 3.0.0 Beta 6, Mac Mouse Fix will be “Notarized”. That

means no more messages about Mac Mouse Fix being potentially “Malicious

Software” when opening the app for the first time.</p>

<p>Notarizing your app costs $100 per year. I was always against this,

since it felt hostile towards free and open source software like Mac

Mouse Fix, and it also felt like a dangerous step towards Apple

controlling and locking down the Mac like they do iOS. But lack of

Notarization led to pretty severe problems, including <a

href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/discussions/114">several

situations</a> where nobody could use the app anymore until I released a

new version. Since Mac Mouse Fix will be monetized now, I thought it was

finally appropriate to Notarize the app for an easier and more stable

user experience.</p>

<h2 id="chinese-translations">6. Chinese Translations</h2>

<p>Mac Mouse Fix is now available in Chinese! More specifically, it’s

available in:</p>

<ul>

<li>Chinese, Traditional</li>

<li>Chinese, Simplified</li>

<li>Chinese (Hong Kong)</li>

</ul>

<p>Huge thanks to <span class="citation"

data-cites="groverlynn">@groverlynn</span> for providing all of these

translations as well as for updating them throughout the betas and

communicating with me. See his pull request here:

https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/pull/395.</p>

<h2 id="everything-else">7. Everything Else</h2>

<p>Aside from the changes listed above Beta 6 also features many smaller

improvements.</p>

<ul>

<li>Removed several options from the “Click”, “Click and Hold” and

“Click and Scroll” Actions because I thought they were redundant since

the same functionality can be achieved otherwise and since this cleans

up the menus a lot. Will bring those options back if people complain. So

if you miss those options - please complain.</li>

<li>Click and Drag direction will now match trackpad swipe direction

even when “Natural scrolling” is turned off under System Settings &gt;

Trackpad. Before, Click and Drag would always behave like swiping on the

trackpad with “Natural scrolling” turned <em>on</em>.</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where the cursors would disappear and then reappear

somewhere else when using a “Click and Drag” Action during a screen

recording or when using the DisplayLink software.</li>

<li>Fixed centering of the “+” in the “+”-Field on the Buttons tab</li>

<li>Several visual Improvements to the buttons tab. The color palette of

the “+”-Field and Action Table has been reworked to look correct when

using macOS’ “Allow wallpaper tinting in windows” option. The borders of

the Action Table now have a transparent color that looks more dynamic

and adjusts to its surroundings.</li>

<li>Made it so when you add lots of actions to the action table and the

Mac Mouse Fix window grows, it will grow exactly as large as the screen

(or as the screen minus the dock if you don’t have dock-hiding enabled)

and then stop. When you add even more actions, the action table will

start scrolling.</li>

<li>This Beta now supports a new checkout where you can buy a license in

US dollars as advertised. Before you could only buy a license in Euros.

The old Euro licenses will still be supported of course.</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where momentum scrolling sometimes wasn’t started

when using the “Scroll &amp; Navigate” feature.</li>

<li>When the Mac Mouse Fix window resizes itself during a tab switch it

will now reposition itself so it does not overlap with the Dock</li>

<li>Fixed flicker on some UI elements when switching from the Buttons

tab to another tab</li>

<li>Improved appearance of animation that the “+”-Field plays after

recording an input. Especially on macOS versions before Ventura, where

the shadow of the “+”-Field would appear glitched during the

animation.</li>

<li>Disabled notifications listing several buttons that have been

captured/are no longer captured by Mac Mouse Fix which would appear when

starting the app for the first time or when loading a preset. I thought

these messages were distracting and slightly overwhelming and not really

helpful and those contexts.</li>

<li>Reworked the Grant Accessibility Screen. It will now show

information about why Mac Mouse Fix needs Accessibility Access inline

instead of linking to the website and it is a little clearer and has a

more visually pleasing layout.</li>

<li>Updated Acknowledgements link on the About tab.</li>

<li>Improved error messages when Mac Mouse Fix can’t be enabled because

there’s another version present on the system. The message will now be

displayed in a floating alert window which always stays on top of other

windows until dismissed instead of a Toast Notification which disappears

when clicking anywhere. This should make it easier to follow the

suggested solution steps.</li>

<li>Fixed some issues with markdown rendering on macOS versions before

Ventura. MMF will now use a custom markdown rendering solution for all

macOS Versions, including Ventura. Before we were using a system API

introduced in Ventura but that lead to inconsistencies. Markdown is used

to add links and emphasis to text across the UI.</li>

<li>Polished the interactions around enabling accessibility access.</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where the app window would sometimes open without

showing any content until you switched to one of the tabs.</li>

<li>Fixed an issue with the “+”-Field where you sometimes couldn’t add a

new action even though it showed a hover effect indicating that you can

enter an action.</li>

<li>Fixed a deadlock and several other small issues that would sometimes

happen when moving the mouse pointer inside the “+”-Field</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where a popover that appears on the Buttons tab when

your mouse doesn’t seem to fit the current button settings would

sometimes have all bold text.</li>

<li>Updated all mentions of the old MIT license to the new MMF license.

New files created for the project will now contain an autogenerated

header mentioning the MMF license.</li>

<li>Made switching to the Buttons tab enable MMF for Scrolling.

Otherwise, you couldn’t record Click and Scroll gestures.</li>

<li>Fixed some issues where button names were not displaying correctly

in Action Table in some situations.</li>

<li>Fixed bug where the trial section on the About screen would look

buggy when opening the app and then switching to the trial tab after the

trial expired.</li>

<li>Fixed a bug where Activate License link in the trial section of the

About Tab sometimes didn’t react to clicks.</li>

<li>Fixed a memory leak when using the “Click and Drag” for “Spaces

&amp; Mission Control” feature.</li>

<li>Enabled Hardened runtime on the main Mac Mouse Fix app, improving

security</li>

<li>Lots of code cleanup, project restructuring</li>

<li>Several other crashes fixed</li>

<li>Several memory leaks fixed</li>

<li>Various small UI string tweaks</li>

<li>Reworks of several internal systems also improved robustness and

behavior in edge cases</li>
