<p><strong>3.0.0</strong> will be the <strong>biggest update</strong> to

Mac Mouse Fix so far!</p>

<p>Bringing together many features that I’ve worked on for a long time

to finally deliver this awesome <strong>value proposal</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>Make your $10 mouse better than an Apple

Trackpad!</strong></p>

<p>And you can <strong>test it now</strong>! I’m really excited to hear

your guys’ feedback!</p>

<p>Here is <strong>everything that’s new</strong>:</p>

<h2 id="click-and-drag-to-scroll">1. Click and Drag to Scroll</h2>

<p>You can now <strong>Click and Drag to Scroll</strong> freely in any

direction!</p>

<p>It also allows you to go back and forward in <strong>Safari</strong>,

mark messages as read in <strong>Mail</strong>, and <strong>do anything

else</strong> you can do with a <strong>two-finger swipe</strong> on an

<strong>Apple Trackpad</strong>!</p>

<p>I worked hard to implement the feature to this quality standard. But

as a result, as you play around with it, I think you’ll find it really

“<strong>just works</strong>”!</p>

<h2 id="scroll-gestures">2. Scroll Gestures</h2>

<p>Mac Mouse Fix now supports <strong>Scroll Gestures</strong>! That

means you can <strong>trigger actions</strong> by

<strong>scrolling</strong> while holding down a mouse button!</p>

<p>Scroll Gestures let you get even <strong>more functionality</strong>

out of a single mouse button in a super <strong>intuitive</strong>

way.</p>

<p>In this beta, there are the <strong>following</strong> Scroll

Gestures:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Desktop &amp; Launchpad</strong> allows you to reveal the

Desktop or open Launchpad by scrolling either up or down. This feels

super fluid and intuitive because it simulates pinching with 4 fingers

on an Apple Trackpad.</li>

<li><strong>Move between Spaces</strong> lets you switch between Spaces

by scrolling up or down. This feels super fluid as well since it

simulates swiping on an Apple Trackpad with 3 fingers. However, I’m not

sure if this is redundant since you can already Click and Drag to move

between Spaces. Let me know what you think!</li>

<li><strong>Zoom in or out</strong> lets you take a closer look on the

web or elsewhere. This was already available in Mac Mouse Fix 2 by

holding the Command (⌘) key while scrolling, but now you can do it more

easily using just one hand!</li>

<li><strong>Horizontal Scroll</strong> lets you scroll left and right.

You can also use it to navigate between pages in Safari and other apps

because simulates swiping with 2 fingers on an Apple Trackpad.</li>

<li><strong>Swift Scroll</strong> lets you scroll large distances with

minimal effort.</li>

<li><strong>Precise Scroll</strong> lets you scroll small distances and

use sensitive UI Elements like volume sliders with precision.</li>

<li><strong>App Switcher</strong> lets you switch between recent apps,

just like pressing Command-Tab (⌘ + ↹) on your keyboard. This feature

has some bugs and I’m not sure it’s very useful, since you can already

easily access the Tab Switcher from your keyboard, so I’ll probably

remove it later. Let me know what you think, though.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="inertial-scrolling">3. Inertial Scrolling</h2>

<p><strong>Inertial Scrolling</strong> makes scrolling on your mouse

feel just as <strong>fast</strong> and <strong>fluid</strong> as an

Apple Trackpad.</p>

<p>Inertial Scrolling creates <strong>long</strong> and very

<strong>smooth animations</strong>. On a scroll wheel, long animations

generally come with the tradeoff of less control.</p>

<p>But Mac Mouse Fix 3 implements some <strong>smart algorithms</strong>

to give you a <strong>great intertial feel</strong> while still offering

a lot of <strong>control</strong>.</p>

<p>By the way, if you download this Beta, I think you’ll be <strong>one

of the first</strong> humans to use <strong>scroll bouncing</strong>

from a mouse! (other than the Magic Mouse) I think that’s kinda

cool.</p>

<h2 id="other-scrolling-improvements">4. Other Scrolling

Improvements</h2>

<p>I <strong>rewrote</strong> most of the scrolling code for MMF 3. This

allowed me to implement many <strong>other small features</strong> and

improvements:</p>

<ol type="1">

<li>There are now <strong>2 additional keyboard modifiers</strong> so

you can not only <strong>Zoom in or out</strong> with Command (⌘), and

<strong>Scroll Horizontally</strong> with Shift (⇧), but also

<strong>Scroll Swiftly</strong> with Control (^) and <strong>Scroll

Precisely</strong> with Option (⌥).</li>

<li>You can now see and <strong>customize all 4 keyboard

modifiers</strong> using a beautiful and intuitive new UI.</li>

<li><strong>Always-On Precise Scrolling</strong> lets you scroll

precisely even without holding down a modifier key by moving the scroll

wheel slowly.</li>

<li><strong>Horizontal Scroll Input</strong> from your mouse is no

longer ignored, but instead it’s smoothed and inverted just like normal

vertical scroll input. If your mouse has a <strong>tilt wheel</strong>

or a <strong>horizontal scroll wheel</strong> it should feel much nicer

now.</li>

<li>The <strong>Scroll Direction Invert Settings</strong> are now

independent of the System Settings allowing for a less complicated

UI.</li>

<li><strong>Scroll settings</strong> can now be

<strong>combined</strong> more freely. For example, you can use

<strong>Mac Mouse Fix’s</strong> Scroll Speed even when Smooth Scrolling

is <strong>disabled</strong>. Or you can use <strong>macOS’s</strong>

Scroll Speed when Smooth Scrolling is <strong>enabled</strong>. (Note: I

personally don’t like macOS’ Scroll Speed at all and I can’t think of

reasons why anyone would prefer it. So if you do prefer it I’d be very

interested to learn more about your experience! You can reach out

through the “<strong>ⓘ About</strong>” Tab.)</li>

</ol>

<h2 id="menu-bar-item">5. Menu Bar Item</h2>

<p>Mac Mouse Fix now has a <strong>Menu Bar Item</strong> so you can

always see when it’s enabled!</p>

<p>The Menu Bar Item has a <strong>beautiful icon</strong>, and it also

allows you to <strong>quickly disable</strong> certain features of Mac

Mouse Fix so you can play a game or use an app without Mac Mouse Fix

interfering.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also still <strong>disable</strong> it for a

cleaner Menu Bar.</p>

<h2 id="app-specific-settings-have-been-removed">6. App-Specific

Settings Have Been Removed</h2>

<p><strong>App-Specific Settings</strong> are gone for now. However, I

do plan to <strong>bring them back</strong> in a much more robust and

powerful form in the future.</p>

<p>For now, I think the quick settings in the <strong>Menu Bar</strong>

Item are a <strong>better</strong>, if less convenient, solution.</p>

<p>They <strong>solve</strong> the <strong>most important

problems</strong> of the old App-Specific Settings:</p>

<ul>

<li>App-Specific Settings didn’t work with some programs like

<strong>command line executables</strong>. This included popular apps

like <strong>Minecraft</strong>.</li>

<li>App-Specific Settings had many limitations like they didn’t allow

you to <strong>turn off buttons</strong> entirely, which was a problem

for many gamers.</li>

</ul>

<p>Another thing to consider is that the old App-Specific Settings were

originally <strong>designed as a bandaid</strong> for some apps being

incompatible with the old scrolling system. But now, with the new

scrolling system precisely emulating Touch Scrolls coming from an Apple

Trackpad, most of these incompatibilities should be <strong>fixed

anyways</strong>! So there should be less of a need for what the old

App-Specific Settings were best at.</p>

<p>I hope everone is okay with that! Let me know your

<strong>thoughts</strong>!</p>

<h2 id="ui-overhaul">7. UI Overhaul</h2>

<p>I’ve completely <strong>rewritten the UI</strong> to be more

<strong>beautiful</strong> and <strong>powerful</strong> while still

retaining the <strong>simplicity</strong> and <strong>ease of

use</strong> that people love about Mac Mouse Fix.</p>

<p>Here’s what’s new:</p>

<ul>

<li>The UI is now split up into different <strong>tabs</strong>. This

cleans things up and allows Mac Mouse Fix to provide additional settings

that are important to people without the UI becoming too complicated or

overwhelming. This will also allow me to extend Mac Mouse Fix with new

features in the future.</li>

<li>I added subtle and delightful little <strong>animations</strong> all

over the new UI that make it easier to navigate and add a feeling of

polish.</li>

<li>Options that depend on other options will be <strong>hidden</strong>

and the layout will adjust with beautiful subtle animations. This keeps

things as simple and streamlined as possible. So you don’t have to waste

time and brainpower looking at options that you don’t need to be

thinking about.</li>

<li>The new UI features small <strong>hints</strong> for options that

can otherwise be confusing.</li>

<li>The <strong>new Action Table design</strong> makes it much clearer

how to add and remove Actions, which many people were confused by. It

also shrinks and grows to fit the number of Actions so you don’t have to

resize it manually.</li>

<li>The new <strong>About Tab</strong> features a beautiful layout, and

puts additional options for support, feedback, and more at your

fingertips.</li>

<li>Some <strong>existing UI strings</strong> have been improved.</li>

<li>There’s now a <strong>new option</strong> to Lock the Mouse Pointer

during Click and Drag Gestures. I don’t have one to test, but this

should be very nice for Trackball-Mice!</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="monetization">8. Monetization</h2>

<p>Mac Mouse Fix 3 will be <strong>free for 30 days</strong> and then

cost <strong>$1.99</strong> to own.</p>

<p>I know that paying for something that used to be free is not the best

feeling, but I hope I can convince you that it’s a really <strong>good

thing for the project</strong>!</p>

<p>Like for every other aspect of Mac Mouse Fix, I paid great attention

to making the <strong>user experience</strong> as

<strong>simple</strong> and <strong>pleasant</strong> as possible:</p>

<ol type="1">

<li>The <strong>30 free days</strong> are smartly implemented. Mac Mouse

Fix <strong>only counts the days</strong> on which you <strong>actually

use it</strong>. So there’s <strong>no pressure</strong> to use the app

before the time is up, and you can make an informed decision whether you

want to buy the app or not without any stress.</li>

<li>After the 30 free days are over, <strong>paying</strong> for the app

is extremely <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>fast</strong>. You can

use all the payment methods you love like <strong>Apple Pay</strong> and

<strong>PayPal</strong>, and it only takes <strong>2 clicks</strong> to

pay from inside the app via Apple Pay!</li>

<li>After you bought the app for $1.99, <strong>activating your

license</strong> is also extremely <strong>simple</strong>. I actually

put a <strong>link</strong> on the <strong>checkout screen</strong> in

the web browser that takes you <strong>directly</strong> into the app

and opens the <strong>screen for entering the license</strong> for

you!</li>

<li>After you <strong>activate your license</strong>, there’s a cute

randomized <strong>thank you message</strong> on the about tab. (I heard

there are even some super secret rare ones…)</li>

<li>Your license is <strong>synced via iCloud</strong> so it will

automatically be available on all your computers!</li>

</ol>

<p>By helping Mac Mouse Fix financially, you can also help me

<strong>spend a lot more time</strong> on it and make it the

<strong>best mouse driver EVERRR</strong>. I also <em>love</em> spending

time on Mac Mouse Fix, so that would also make me <strong>happy</strong>

:)</p>

<p><strong>Will Mac Mouse Fix still be Open Source?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. Mac Mouse Fix will still be open source, and I don’t plan to

change that at any point.</p>

<p>This also means you <em>can</em> use Mac Mouse Fix for free by

building it from source and disabling the licensing checks. That’s

perfectly fine, I just discourage sharing these cracked versions online.

And of course, on the next update, you’ll get a non-cracked version

which means you’ll have to do this again for every update. (Or just pay

$1.99 for the greatest mouse driver ever! :)</p>

<p>Anyone will also still be able to use source code from Mac Mouse Fix

in their free and commercial products as long as they don’t just sell a

copy of Mac Mouse Fix without adding their own contribution.</p>

<p>Learn about the details in the new <a

href="https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/blob/version-3/LICENSE">MMF

License</a> which MMF 3 will be licensed under.</p>

<p><strong>Will I have to pay to use the Mac Mouse Fix 3

Beta?</strong></p>

<p>No. You can just use your 30 free days. The free day counter probably

won’t reset when the stable version of Mac Mouse Fix 3 releases, since

that would be extra stuff to design and implement and I don’t think

anyone will care too much. (Let me know if you do). But I will extend

the number of free days if the beta goes on for more than 30 days.</p>

<p><strong>Can I get Mac Mouse Fix for free if I already

donated?</strong></p>

<p>Yes! If you bought me a milkshake before the 10th of September 2022,

you can write an email to noah.n.public@gmail.com with “Milkshake Karma”

in the subject and a screenshot as proof and then I’ll send you a 100%

off discount code or something!</p>

<h2 id="internationalization">9. Internationalization</h2>

<p>With the UI rewrite, it’s now possible to <strong>translate</strong>

Mac Mouse Fix into different languages!</p>

<p>I already translated it into <strong>German</strong>, my native

language, and you can translate it into <strong>your language</strong>,

too!</p>

<p>I plan to write a more <strong>detailed guide</strong> on this in the

future, but if you want to give it a go, here’s a small overview of the

<strong>steps</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Download</strong> the source code &amp; Xcode</li>

<li><strong><a

href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-support-for-languages-and-regions">Add

your language</a></strong> to the project</li>

<li>Put your translations into the

<strong><code>.strings</code></strong> and

<strong><code>.stringsdict</code></strong> files throughout the

project</li>

<li><strong>Commit</strong> your changes and create a <strong>pull

request</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>If your translation is added to the project you’ll get <strong>10 MMF

copies for free</strong>, and of course, you’ll be <strong>credited as a

contributor</strong>. I heard you can also leave your <strong>personal

message</strong> by changing some of the (secret rare thank you

messages) on the About tab.</p>

<p>Maybe I’ll add <strong>more perks</strong> in the future. Let me know

if you have any <strong>ideas</strong> for that!</p>

<h2 id="how-you-can-help">10. How You Can Help</h2>

<p>You can help by sharing your <strong>ideas</strong>,

<strong>issues</strong> and <strong>feedback</strong>!</p>

<p>The best place to share your <strong>ideas</strong> and

<strong>issues</strong> is the <a
